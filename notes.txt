1. Define Core Features
Pharmacy-Specific Scheduler: Allows patients to book appointments online.
Patient Engagement Tools: Automated messaging for follow-ups, mass email updates, secure video calls.
Practice Growth Analytics: Basic dashboard showing appointment trends, patient demographics.

2. Tech Stack Setup
Frontend: Set up a React application.
Backend: Initialize a Node.js/TypeScript project with GraphQL.
Database: Install PostgreSQL and design a simple schema for appointments, patients, and communications.
Containerization: Dockerize the frontend and backend for easier deployment and scalability.
Cloud Infrastructure: Set up an AWS account and familiarize yourself with services like S3, RDS, Lambda, SES/SNS for future integration.

3. Development Steps
Frontend (React)
Step 1: Create basic UI components for appointment booking, patient registration, and the dashboard.
Step 2: Implement state management for handling data across components.
Backend (Node.js/TypeScript with GraphQL)
Step 1: Set up a GraphQL server.
Step 2: Develop APIs for managing appointments, patient data, and communications.
Step 3: Implement authentication to secure patient data.
Database (PostgreSQL)
Step 1: Design tables for storing user, appointment, and communication data.
Step 2: Establish connections between your backend and the database.
Dockerize Application
Step 1: Create Dockerfiles for both the frontend and backend.
Step 2: Use Docker Compose to orchestrate multi-container deployment.

4. Testing
Perform unit tests on backend logic.
Conduct integration tests to ensure frontend and backend interaction is smooth.

5. Deployment
Option 1: Manually deploy your Docker containers to a cloud service.
Option 2: Use CI/CD pipelines (like GitHub Actions) for automated testing and deployment to AWS.

6. MVP Evaluation and Iteration
Gather feedback from a small group of users.
Prioritize additional features and improvements based on feedback.
Additional Tips
Start with mock data to test the flow of the application.
Utilize open-source libraries and frameworks to accelerate development.
Document your API endpoints and component interactions for easier debugging and future development.
